A hotel data analysis project using Python involves analyzing and visualizing hotel-related data to gain insights, improve decision-making, and optimize business strategies. Here's a short overview:

Objectives:
Understand customer behavior and booking trends.
Analyze occupancy rates, revenue, and cancellations.
Identify factors affecting customer preferences and satisfaction.
Key Steps:

Data Collection:
Gather data from sources like hotel booking systems, online travel agencies, or publicly available datasets (e.g., the Hotel Booking Demand Dataset).

Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Convert date columns and categorize variables for easier analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:
Analyze booking trends (seasonality, lead times, and length of stay).
Investigate cancellation rates and reasons.
Compare performance between city and resort hotels.

Feature Analysis:
Study customer demographics, preferences, and special requests.
Evaluate how factors like room types, market segments, or distribution channels impact bookings.

Data Visualization:
Create graphs (e.g., line charts, heatmaps) to showcase patterns and insights.

This project is widely applicable in the hospitality industry to improve customer satisfaction, optimize pricing, and increase profitability.
